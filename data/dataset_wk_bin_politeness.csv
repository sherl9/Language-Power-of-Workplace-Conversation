"It is disputed among admins regarding the protection of userpages, although the policy says that users can have their user/user sub-pages (but not the talks) semi-protected if the user requests it. Are there other subpages of yours that you'd like protecting?",1
"What fact that was recently prooved is referred to? And since when is pi the ratio of circumference to radius, rather than circumference to diameter?",0
"Alright, I don't like it but is not worth wasting more time on, but (as you now noticed as well) if it ''really'' had been deleted for <url>, it would have been truly problematic. Can I just ask: ''if'' Mephistophelian would return, are we allowed to undelete it?",0
"Thanks! By the way, have you sent anything to Maggie since you received the email from the photographer?",1
"You are right, I apologize not doing so. A different layout for the template could be interesting (perhaps even with names, or those delivered in person/by text) but I didn't quite see the logic in the way you had broken up the dates by 20 year blocks interspaced with 4 year blocks, right?",1
"Nice continued work on the expressway articles. Is it possible to have some maps or schematic diagrams showing the location or routes of the expressways?",1
"I'm not sure what you mean? Add my interests?",0
"At the top of the page it characterizes a guideline as ''a generally accepted standard that editors should follow'' along with a passing reference to <url>. So, I might ask, how would using 4 tildes prevent you from improving or maintaining Wikipedia?",0
"I've added a note to <url> to explain the dating; there's another couple of places it should go, but I don't want to start putting it in 'til you've seen it. What do you reckon?",1
"If you don't agree with this approach, you can ether add the references yourself, or delete the added material and I will go elsewhere and write something else, and you can take over doing the anti-tank warfare article 'properly'. Ok?",0
"Hi there, you entered info in the bio of <url>, saying he is related to <url>. Do you have any more info on the specific relationship, and also how they were related to <url> ?",1
"Are you really denying that you brought Giano and Bishonen's names into this? Seriously?",0
"Six months ago was episode 10, and has peter not been in every episode up to and including that? Seriously, where are you getting your figures?",0
"That's a <url>-length rant. Still, be nice and AGF, okay?",0
"Here, let me parse it out for you:''I regret that because Gravitor and Carfiend's behavior consists of acting in tandem (in the manner of meat or sock puppets), refuse to discuss disputed content on the talk page, and continally provoke revert wars that some administrative intervention is likely required. '' Is it clear now?",0
"I would be willing to move this article to the incubator so that it can be worked on (I agree it wouldn't be an A7 today), though if it's to be made into a real article it needs to be done with someone with no conflict of interest regarding the subject, as creating articles for things you own is highly discouraged. If I undelete it to the incubator would you agree to let it go and leave it up to other users without a conflict of interest?",1
"Hi, Leandrod - my computer is slow, and your last two edits were made on top of vandalism that needed to be reverted - I can't tell if I reverted legit changes by you or not? If I did, I'm sorry, can you have a look?",1
"As a side note, I'm slightly amused that on the one hand, you caution me not to encourage the penguieater troll, explicitly striking out the mocking part, but then in the same breath you sign the finding that cites those same penguin diffs as evidence of terrible insults and intimidation. Slightly inconsistent, perhaps?",0
"I was thinking about creating a page about Nintendo eShop. And since you are a well trusted user I am asking you if you think that would just be deleted because there isn't enough information?",1
"Just wondering, is there any reason why you removed categories from a number of articles and replaced them with the non-existend <url>. Wouldn't <url> have been the better choice, which, as it appears, is a category you yourself created a few days ago?",0
"Changing your userpage doesn't answer my question. Why is your userpage a copy of <url>'s?",0
"Thank you. Was it anything in particular?",1
"I hope Ed's doesn't look like mine. Wait--what is this navbar we're talking about?",0
"To whom are you referring, Hipicrite? Who has a secret opinion?",0
"I saw on the status page that you have a free spot. Would you be able to coach me?",1
"Have made some comments on your list, looks pretty good overall, my points are just picky ones! Any chance you could return the favour and have a look over <url> for me?",1
"Helllo?????",0
"Do we have an automated-edit-using editor who's decided to just stick these in for completeness' sake? Did I miss all this?",0
"I have not seen quotation sections on any other Australian politician page. Also, who chose these quotations? What qualifies as a quotation?",0
"By the way: Do you know how to remove the spaces created below the project banner when others are placed below it? And how to make capitalisation of the rating not matter?",1
"OK, we are talking about two remaining articles here. The categories serve absolutely no categorization purpose, so why are you being stubborn about it?",0
"The information itself obviously demonstrates notability. I'm sure other sources can be found, however&mdash;will you back off if other sources are added?",0
"I notice that to the <url> and <url> pages edited '''''Gorka''''' '''Josxe9 Unda Velasco''' and changed it to simply ''Gorka''. Why?",0
"I know this is a bit outside your usual territory but I wonder if you would be interested in helping us get <url> to FA status in time for the 50th anniversary of the line's closure on 10 June 2011? A question has also arisen in connection with the proper referencing of a journal article using the sfn template: when quoting a journal article - say from January 2010 - should the correct formulation be <nowiki><person></nowiki> or should the month be dropped?",1
"Hi there, I've found some peer-reviewed publications that discuss Hoser's work. Could you take another look at the article and the AfD discussion?",1
"Thank you, Cremepuff222, for the kind words. :) How have you been?",1
"Jeez, Joe, and I was going to suggest you hang around Andrea's to make sure he doesn't do himself a disservice... What is this? Getting blocked is the new cool?",0
"Your reasoning is very sound, it would appear that USGS is wrong and I have no problem with changing it back. In general, what are your thoughts on using the GNIS database for park coordinates/elevations as we convert to the Geobox?",1
"Hi. How do you think, is <url> of FL quality?",1
"What do you mean they are not related to the scope of <url>? Like which articles?",0
"Excellent, thanks! I wonder if it's worth temporarily uploading a cropped image for the main page, as 100x100 is really very small?",1
"Hey thanks for reassessing the <url> article to B class. So what's need to be done to make it GA?",1
"Thanks for adding the WSL windmill picture. I see you are in Belgium, any chance of adding more pictures to the various lists?",1

"Wow that's old! What do you think of <url>?",0
"Hi, I am having problems with one of the references you added as it goes to the main page and not to one showing any of the figures on religion. Can you have a look at <url>?",1
"When we have a GLAM barnstar then you get it ..... just for the Hindi article! I cannot explain why you needed to create a Derby page in Hindi - surely it should be there already?",0
"Unless im making a major mistake here, this article was about a Not for profit organisation which seemed notable enough to give the origional creator at least some time to source it. Are you sure this had to be a speedy?",0
"Hi there, I've raised the possibility of unprotecting the tamazepam page <url>. What are your thoughts?",1
"In your nom of Everyking you wrote ''...as Everyking is a former administrator, he made over 1,300 in his 2+ year time as a sysop.'' Should that be over 1,300 sysop actions?",0
"Done. Does Adam Hunter need your disambig-style touch?",0
"I'm always happy to give a second opinion on ID - you're welcome to put images on my talk page to discuss them. Regarding <url>, I would tend to go with ''<url>'', what do you think?",1
"I'm sorry, but I don't see the value in having different criteria for two versions of the same list, one sorted by name and one sorted by nationality. Every other list and article on space travel uses the altitude definition, why would the sub-list sorted by nationality be different?",0

"Sorry, I dont quite remember what we were talking about. Can you tell me what you were/are confused about?",1

"I'm curious as to why you chose to <url> a full two minutes after my last comment? Am I to take this as a sign you are no longer willing to discuss the issue?",0
"<url> has been promoted to A-class. Shouldn't that score?",0
"I received a message from the bot you run telling me that one of two duplicate files I uploaded is due for speedy deletion. If possible, could it be made that Bath_badge.png is the one that is deleted, rather than Bath_rugby_badge.png please?",1
"Acad, at <url> the article suddenly starts talking about ''Pomone'' without any context - is this a typo? You're a major contributor - can you clarify?",0
"Ah well, if you are going to have such a bizarre flight of fancy as far as to calling it an attack page then perhaps I will remove it. Maybe you should also look at how you interact with others?",0
"You know there's no excuse for the edits you're making related to your position at <url>. This has to go to <url>; would you like to make the report?",0

"Was it you who deleted the section in Victor Garber's article about his sexuality and his partner? If yes, what was the reason?",0
"Why did you remove those German emigrant cases. Shouldn't we include those cases of people who was born in what was then Germany at the time?",0
"Granted, it wouldn't be terribly difficult for me to recreate what I did, but I don't like doing extra work when I don't have to. Could you at least userfy the last version edited by me?",0
"I was actually going to work on your suggestions today, regarding the GA nomination for <url>. Do you mind reopening the nomination?",1
"I appreciate your effort to seek consensus through a merge proposal before merging <url> to <url>, but as you are no doubt aware, no one participated in the discussion, meaning that while there was no articulated consensus against it, there was also no consensus for it. May I recommend undoing the merge for now, re-opening the discussion, and seeking wider input at the relatively large number of WikiProjects that handle those articles?",1
"Thanks. Do you feel the information is weak or is it just too complex?",1
"The reason given on the <nowiki><person></nowiki> tag (''Non-notable book promo'') seems to have nothing at all to do with the article. Is this on the correct article?",0
"Does it not take just a bit more than someone saying they own it to remove a copyvio? As can be seen I post from Canada and what's to stop me claiming to be <url> and anything published in the <url> can be put on Wikipedia (or something a little more sensible)?",0
"... but when you do things like <url>, I start distancing myself. What made you come to that decision if you did differently on the <url> and <url>?",0
"Can you explain what you mean by ''Randi, paranormal, Larry King etc. are all redundant redundant''?",0
"Yes, I agree. Would you please make the appropriate change?",1

"I have always maintained a control of the military section and I can check up the names in the educational section. Which section would you like to clean-up?",1
"Since I have not been able to get an answer to this on the project page, let me ask you directly: Did you receive Durova's secret evidence prior to the blocking of <url>?",0

"''Don't'' talk ''about'' me, in my virtual presence, and tell someone else to ignore me. Do you understand why this behavior is inappropriate?",0
"Re your e-mail, there is info there which is not on my talk page. May I add it to my talk page, or would you prefer it stayed off?",1
"That's a good idea. What about army and corps HQs though?",1
"Sounds good. Could you drop Fritzpoll a note?",1

"There's been a slow revert war occurring between <url> and <url> over the Katja Kassin article and I've just left a strongly worded suggestion that they hash out their differences in the article's talk page. Could you keep an eye on the article for a day or two, just to make sure they stop reverting and start discussing?",1

"Really? Why?",0
"Even worse: The authorized use of this data is limited to informational and educational purposes only, and NOT for operational or commercial purposes. This clearly disqualifies the text for Wikipedia purposes, I'm afraid we'll have to delete the article. Do you know of any similar contributions you've made?",0
"Hi, I hadn't realized that you had made a revert on redirecting this. Could you see my comments on <url>?",1

"I have started to fix it. Can you help?",1
"Why have you included the Putnam Line in the MTA infobox, when it was never operated by the MTA (excepting the Marble Hill stub, which is hardly on a par with the Hudson Line, Harlem Line, etc.)?",0
"You call what I did wikistalking yet these editors are allowed to do the same thing to me? Where's the sense in that?",0
"I have to protest that I find it rather meaningless to present arguments on the talk page for edits which are then blankly reverted by the likes of User:Historicar without explanation or discussion. Any suggestions for a more formal process or other remedies?",0
"I do have one semi-newbie question: I made some edits under my IP before registering (<url>) and would like to claim them now that I have registered. Do you know if that's possible, and if so, how to go about it?",1
"Don't add any more trash to the article. Got it?",0
"I think I lot of the things on the Methuselah page are very interesting, but perhaps should be transferred to the Biblical Generations article, if they touch on more than just Methuselah. Would you agree?",1

"Hello, sorry I probably should have asked first, but I thought it might be a good idea to nominate one of the images you uploaded, <url>, for featured picture. I hope you don't mind me taking the liberty, as it were?",1
"No, I didn't know that. Where does this rule come from?",0
"I see you created a nonsense article yesterday because you were bored. If I unblock you will you disrupt more?",0

"Hi Michael, have you ever heard of this term before? Does it have wide usage?",1
"Owing to your status as an active wikipedian, I'm not yet reverting your edit to this article. But what sense is it to move his birth location from the birthdate position in line one, to the top of (a newly formed) paragraph 2 which then (continues from the former paragraph 1 subject) takes off on a subject entirely unrelated to his birth?",0
"Hey, what do you think if instead of naming surahs like this <url>, we add the surah number to each like : Surah 1, Al-Fatiha. Would u agree with such page moves?",1

"There may not be a lot of situations like this, but there will definitely be some.

"What City in Connecticut do you live in? And have you been to the north as your name suggests?",0
"Thanks. Can you leave a comment at <url>, saying you are the creator?",1
"I'm curious how you justify your removal of a link to the Washington Blade newspaper website in the <url> article<url>. The Blade is a valid media outlet - a newspaper dating back to 1969. Is there some bias at work?",0

"Hi JoJan. I see that the template which listed the failed FA attempt on <url> was deleted from the talk page, and I wanted to ask if that is considered OK or not?",1
"I was not trying to sound rude earlier. Haunted Angel which of my seven reasons had you decided were evidence of his sock puppetry?",0

"I see the dilemma with separate series.. in the case with (untranslated) Spirou there are no such problems, but it seems to make more sense, with no english publication, to switch the brackets for english and original titles (ex: <url>). Does this create a problem with continuity?",1
"Concerning <url>, I must say I am a bit confused: isn't the article's title Austria<span style=color:red>u2013</span>Hungary (where, incidentally, it was moved after an Austria<span style=color:red>-</span>Hungary period)? It's really no big deal, but how can something be both correct and incorrect, and which standard are we at long last supposed to follow?",0

"Thank you for your answer about Illustrator. How does Adobe Illustrator compare with InDesign?",1

"As I said in the summary when moving him away from <url>, for the last twenty-six years of his life he wasn't a priest. Perhaps I've missed the part of the naming convention which requires 'priest', could you please say more?",0
"I do understand the bot was approved and is doing useful job, but. Is it possible to modify it to not save the changes if it is only one-two whitespace(s)?",1

"Great- so bump up to around ten selected pictures (selective choices, obviously) and then you feel it is ready for FPOC? Is there anything you feel the portal is obviously lacking?",1
"I could have a go. When would you need it?",1
"Regarding comment on length of Performance reviews section - the intention here is to provide support for the statement in the biography that Latsabidze is already regarded by many as one of the more significant performers of his generation. Do you recommend that I just delete this statement, or is there some other way to support it other than providing representative critical reviews that say so?",1
"I think this deserves its own article, as opposed to being in the centrifugal one. Do you have any good sources that describe how it works?",1
"Yes, I apologize, my friend (I guess I have some kind of a phobia that you will forget about my posts :) ) I will wait as long as you want me to. Could you read Mir Harven's posts on talk page?",1

"What's wrong with having everything look the same, the links are for the Official website of the channel so I don't see the problem??",0
"It's not that, it's just feels ... wrong. An admin especially should be accountable for all his dealings, so why delete the history?",0
"Alright, the NPOV template is even worse, since it specifically points people to a talk page discussion which does not exist. Why are you adding these templates?",0

"Eeeeerrrrr... Could you type a little slower, I am having trouble with the above!?",0
"Multiple editors never occurred to me - I didn't think much about the boxes, and the blocking help page wasn't of much use. Of Block anonymous users only <url>, Prevent account creation <url>, Automatically block the last IP address used by this user, and any subsequent addresses they try to edit from <url>, which should I have checked?",1

"I had no idea that I was such a rogue admin. Are you seriously suggesting that I need to be kicked off the project for closing a deletion debate?",0
"Thanks for your comment. What was done wrong in listing the image for deletion?",1
"You told me that you couldn't access the page in question, although I had recently changed the link to its new location. Maybe you just didn't bother to check it out?",0
"With respect to your format, I think that all the things listed in the section before the sections should be separated as slang refs, phrases using breaking then the other section that appears. What do you think?",1
"... then you have to at least meet me half-way. For instance, ''<url>'' described the episode as displaying an exhilarating flair for rapid change of comic gear and made commented positively on the scene. Can you see the problem here?",0
"I have just noticed that today a Wikipedia administrator added a POV tag in the u201cPsychohistoryu201d article, which you have contributed to edit. Perhaps someone should do a little work to balance the article and remove the tag?",0
"Um, you know that the last couple of replies have been from someone other than Esprqii? Right?",0
"With all due respect, that is going to take ages. How can one create a 'Bot' to do all this for me for <url>, <url>, <url>, <url> and <url>?",1
"Thank you for your time, but, perhaps; If I give you the iformation and images and such for Lord Strachan, could you maybe make it? It shouldn't be that hard to find info, or images, but I already have them, so if I give you this stuff, perhaps could you do it?",1
"He's doing it again, removing Lauren's bottom 2 placing (<url>). I just reverted him but maybe we need to file something at AN/I ?",0

"Corrections, make that four terms: I pick a car and swap, I pick a goat and swap, I pick a car and do not swap, I pick a goat and do not swap. Who cares about doors or door numbers?",0
"Anyway why put up with all this carelessness? Why are sockpuppets and trolls being enabled?",0
"On a more practical note: One either does or doesn't agree to take part in mediation. Which is it, please?",0
"I know, I looked it up and fixed the article, but it was annoying that you just changed one small thing making the page contradict itself. What's the use changing it if the reader will have no idea what's going on?",0
"Who???",0
"sir.. can i still write an article? do you have any facebook account?",1
"Yeah, I already noticed that. Why can't people can just edit in a responsible fashion, or through ''discussion with others''?",0
"No, I have not read it, as it is of no interest to me or this encyclopedia. Are you claiming that the references make the blog post a reliable source, or why are we still discussing this?",0
"Hi Leah, is it working again? I had some difficulties with WP in general a couple of days ago and was wondering if your issues had the same origin?",1
"Is there any consensus for these changes? If I've missed the discussion, I do apologise, but could you post me a link to where it occurred?",1
"As I have said before, it is an issue of breadth vs. depth. Are you familiar with such concepts?",0
"If a main or major purpose of your presence here is to cause drama then I would support your being indefed. Am I misunderstanding something?",0
"Noticed you've been holding the fort alone... again :) Thought I'd drop by and say hello. Surely your sanity has reached its limits by now?",1
"I have moved the page back, as well as created the new article <url>. Is that better?",1
"Thanks. Oh, and if you don't mind, would you please block the sockmaster?",1
"Hi Cmadler, I've written a new ALT hook at the <person> that I think addresses your concerns. Could you sign off on the nomination?",1
"Why did you block tanner1996 that is me I was going to choose Nascar1996 but someone else is using that name??????????",0
"Wikipedia is not the place for new information. How would we know if it was true or not if someone credible hasn't verified it?",0
"I was just reminded of my offer to generate a list of uncategorised templates, when I happened across your bot request again. Are you still interested in such a thing?",1
"I believe that an opinion about AS belongs only to article about AS (and you are welcome to cite the MS opinion ''in proper context''). However an opinion about MS belongs only to article about MS. Is not this fair and logical?",0

"<url>: I am not sure how a regular spy mission gone bad had contributed to the history of cryptography. Should every spy ship, listening post, tampered cable and what not get included in the category?",0

"Well? Shall I request outside assistance?",0
"A challenge for you! What do you think about creating a template for convoys and a list of convoys?",1
"I see that you don't have an account linked to the Wikipedia email. Would you be able to send me a message so that we can talk off Wikipedia?",1

"Thanks. Beer?",1
"Perhaps these articles should be nominated for deletion. A blue belt is far from a notable BJJ player; Google returns 594 results for him, many of which might not even be the Barry Ley in question; and as for the Blaggers article: I don't see any articles on the higher-selling books you mention, why does this one deserve it?",0
"LordAmeth-- once again, many thanks for nominating me. I have a question, though-- I noticed that the process was scheduled to end at 16:52 today, and we're past that now...what happens next?",1
"You reverted my removal of the to critical acclaim description from this article. I cannot see where in <url> there is a basis for that claim - it looks like a neutral factual review to me?",0

"<url> suddenly has a bunch of new entries for today. Did you change the program?",0
"I understand ''your'' position, however I disagree with it, even regarding the spirit. <ins>Mostly because I don't see linking something as modification of the quote, therefore it's a moot point, even when coupled with bracketed additions.</ins> Perhaps we should see<ins>k</ins> comments from additional editors?",0
"You sure kill educating information. I wounder why?",0
"Just now I created this stub. Could you have a look at it, and try to improve it?",1
"Hello, I am interested in helping out with <url> and <url>, but the pages are very very long, which is unmanageable and discouraging. Could you please break them up into (many) smaller subpages?",1
"I'm not sure what you are reffering to. Could you give a link?",1
"Can I also point out that the text that you pasted into Wikipedia is entirely inappropriate for an encyclopedia article and at best will require extensive editing to conform to the<url>.

"All right, I'll bite. Is honorary membership in the Justice League not criteria enough for being listed in that category?",0
"I had an editorial dispute with a user called <url><, but I'm not responding to him anymore as it seems to escalate into heated arguments. If he keeps messaging, would it be ok if I got back in touch with you and you had a word with him?",1
"Done. Comments?",0
"Pat, for someone who has died, you don't say he is a former professional baseball player, you say he was a professional baseball player. Okay?",0
"Problem is how do you recognise the categories, as there are thousands of them. I have already made a program that scans the database, and can locate the unstubbed articles, so finding the untagged stubs is ok, and AWB automatically adds the stub tag if the article is short, I just can't think how you could program it to automatically guess the type of stub, any ideas?",1
"Because Wikipedia is an encylopaedia not a free advertising and self promotion venue. Why do you keep abusing it?",0
"Thanks for putting the igneous rock template on all of those articles - it looks really useful! Do you think it should have an ultramafic section added?",1

"Good job working on the list, thanks. Could you make sure you move them from To do to Done when you finish?",1
"I really think that the text you have drafted at <url> is far fuller and better than the article as currently drafted. Do you have any objection to me deleting the current text (except for the infobox which I will retain) and importing you text in its entirety?",1
"What about ''Race, Ethnicity and Migration in Modern Japan'' (Weiner 2004)? Or any of the dozens of books you can find on Google by searching Ainu+Honshu?",0
"Thanks. Anything else?",1
"Thanks for reverting that obnoxious vandalism on my talk page. How do I bring in an administrator to deal with the vandal?",0
"He used it to assert that '''''others''''' had expressed the notion that the process was concluded and that it was time to move on, and used your statement as evidence of this. Since you did not mean that it had been concluded, and since obviously you were only speaking for yourself and no one else, and participants have been continuing to post on the RfC page and its Talk Page to indicate that they do not feel this way at all, how does it serve to support the idea that they have?",0
"I had that fixed before you oranged me, I swears it! :) Are you not familiar with the technique of doubling your edit count using typos?",0

"Calling all changes for vandalism just because you don't agree with them is NOT the way to explain why you reverts edits. May I suggest that you actually learn what vandalism actually means before you use the word?",0

"So nearly a year later you change it all again. Why?",0
"Hi, Google found your start at a Bayt Nuba article. Do you want help?",1
"Hi! What would you like help with in particular?",1

"I fail to see how you call copyleft selfish, but are fine with the idea of totally proprietary licenses. Wouldn't those be even more selfish, then?",0
"Hi, I have cleaned up this page and, in the AfD, identified many other sources and additional content. I wonder if you would reconsider your delete !vote please (I will do the necessary expansion as and when there is a reasonable expectation of it being kept)?",1

"They did and have done, on my talk page and on their talk page and most the time im not really doing anything and i always seem to get the finger pointed at me. So what do you expect me to do if someone is uncivil towards me?",0
"Oh that's charming, so instead of making a personal attack on a single editor you made it on a class of editors. Does that somehow make it more ok?",0

"<url> posted a wonderful grammatical analysis of the has/had thing, another editor agreed, so I'm thinking we should make another request for the change, using Bluewave's post as the basis. What do you think?",1
"Note: Kurt's talk page almost certainly isn't a good place to seek a broad or unbiased consensus on this question, nor is it the appropriate venue in which to request an exemption from a ban &mdash; and in all honesty, I'm not sure that managing such an exemption for the purpose of posting gags would be a constructive use of anyone's time. Perhaps it would be best to save the jokes for a time when you're once again allowed to edit in the WP namespace, or post whatever jokes you wish (within reason) in your own user space?",0
"Why delete the page <url> with no explanation, as an act of deliberate vandalism? Why did you do it?",0
"Hey, thanks for your contributions here :). Would you mind referencing them to conform with wiki-policy?",1

"Hi, Wereon - I'm afraid I'm rather amateur at nominating articles for deletion. Where do I start?",1
"Otherwise, very nice article. Are you going to submit it to DYK?",1
"To be honest, I'm not sure - the decision say remove individuals and organizations but it also said per BLP and Abascal is deceased. Perhaps you should ask Timrollpickering, the admin who closed the discussion, to clarify?",1

I'm not saying that anyone has or will make that decision--but if that decision is made, are you claiming that you are entitled to do what you want regardless of community consensus to the contrary?",0

"You said other sources supported the info in the infobox yet you did not indicate what sources. And why can't we use a primary source for his birth date?",0

"I've removed my remark. But if somebody puts words in another's mouth, and that second person states that is not what he meant, and the first person responds that no, that ''is'' what the second person meant, well, wouldn't you say that's a little weird?",0
"Hey, I reverted your edits on recognition because the statements were already relayed in footnotes, which I hadn't realised when you brought it up on the talk page. Did you want to move the statements to the main text?",1
"Thanks for the infomative reply -- I wasn't really questioning your putting the image in the infobox; appearance-wise I don't think it makes much difference. It is better, though, I think, to have the thumbnail indicator -- Is it possible to have that inside the infobox?",1
"I've asked participants to shift the discussion away from Karchmar--that discussion isn't producing any new arguments or sources. Would you be able to contribute some thoughts as to where we might go on the topic of collaboration (i.e., tomorrow)?",1
"Hi, thanks for unprotecting the <url> article. Could you also unprotect <url> so a redirect can be created?",1
"Thanks for the heads-up on that; I don't really have anything to add beyond what you'd said. By the way, I noticed you said you weren't an admin: would you like to be?",1
"Also, why is this glorious photo of a <url> not used in any articles? Was there some argument about its copyright status?",0
"Why did you revert my edits on that page? You say it was unsourced but it was sourced, I put two references to two fair sources (not blogs nor politicaly bound), so why did you remove them?",0

"I don't understand what you are trying to ask me or suggest that I do. Can you clarify please?",1
"Answered at <url>. Maybe you are not familiar with the expression?",0

"I know, I understood that. :) I didn't scold you for it at all, did I make you feel that way?",1
"It was for closure's sake, as to show that the debate was closed and that was the result, the user was '''blocked''' and the userpage was '''deleted'''. Doesn't that show you the items better?",0

"I think it is important to note that Spirit 03 was the last gunship to be brought down and that it has not been involved in a Class A mishap since that date. Should we include that?",1

"Also, is <url> about chemistry, sociology, theology, international law, or what?? '''I''' know the answer to that question, but does the person reading the article know?",0

"I don't understand why Hong is so reluctant to revert unilateral changes from time-to-time when he did so frequently in the past when I or someone else who supported my edits did it. What exactly is the point in me agreeing to this if someone conveniently comes along and then starts making lots of changes that I don't like but Giovanni doesn't mind?",0
"Wow! How did you find this?",1
"I use that template, because it cannot be missed on a page, because it allows for different reasons for blocking (template:blocked is vandalism, only, and takes 2 edits to change to something else), and because it gives instructions for requesting unblock. What is the objection to it?",0
"I'm disappointed that your first response here was to revert me without discussion, and to assert a consensus that was not apparent. Before you choose to revert me again, can you ''please'' participate in the discussion at WT:RD?",0
"The main article needs a facelift. Do you want to make suggestions?",1
"I say - are you a sort of picture finder? You couldn't find one of John Bowlby could you?",1
"Not that clear to me. What's wrong with this username?",0
"Thanks. Any idea how I log into this account?",1

"You're a troll. Why not go somewhere else?",0
"It's not off topic, and I see no comment in that other discussion on the merits of WMC's Martian push -- in fact, you evaded the question. So I take it that this is a refusal to answer?",0

"ED... They have drugs to fix that now, don't they?",0
"I am reluctant to mention this, but having your paragraph in bold on <url> seems to me to be a bit self-promotional and unfair to the other members. Is there any chance that I might be able to persuade you to voluntarily unbold it?",1
"I seconded wholeheartedly your proposal at <url>. Could you please add a link to the discussion?",1
"I don't think so, Giano. Can we just once attempt to let this pass by without calling for the heads of people?",0
"Thanks. Does it happen to say anything about his marriage to Paula, as in when it ended?",1
"Thanks, can we write an article on that ? do you think it is notable enough ?",1

"In instances where there is one major usage of a name and several smaller ones it is conventional to leave the major one in the namespace and have a link in the top to the others (or to <url>.

"My graphics editing skills aren't up to the creation of a map such as this from scratch, but I could probably do an adequate job of removing the red and orange lines and the related entries in the map legend. Would it be useful for me to take a whack at that?",1

"But, before you accuse me of shying away from your second to last question, my PhD is in inorganic chemistry, homogeneous catalysis to be specific, but my latest scientific paper was submitted (still with the reviewers) to ''<url>'': it touches on the metrological consequences of the microscopic quantization of ''Q'', as it happens, although that is not its main thrust. So, do you want to thrash this out among scientists, or would you prefer to waste your time with ArbCom?",0
"Thanks for the <nowiki>{{For</nowiki> templates on Tkachyovs, they help a lot. Maybe in this case we should use the patronimics in the titles and have Alexander Tkachyov as a disambig?",1

"Right, so the links on your userpage? And what is the article you want me to check over?",0
"Thanks; I expected a decline, despite my extensive comments at <url>. As there is nothing more to this article than listings of bylines in non-notable publications, minor book acknowledgments, uncredited movie extra roles, blog comments, paid directory listings, and unsubstantiated claims about wildly over-the-top PR accomplishments, what exactly do you consider to be the examples of credible notability?",0

"'''<url>'''Please also answer the questions at paragraph '''<url>''' above, as you are looking like a classic bully admin who abuses his powers and should be stripped of that role. Is there any review process in wikipedia, for proposing that you be stripped of your admin powers for bullyism?",0

"I'm sorry, but I don't see what you're talking about. Could you be more specific?",1
"That is why I suggest the following: either we refer to him as u201cSouth-Netherlandishu201d (like he is described on the Dutch Wikipedia page) or we omit the nationality completely and we just mention the cities he lived in. Does this seem acceptable?",1

"Yes, the licking my balls thing. Why am I not surprised that that was his work too?",0
