"Why not using `isnan()` from math.h? Any specially reason?",0
"Does your project involve some graphical user interface? What do you want to code?",1
"Usually compilers should generate a good code for such algorithms. Did you check what assembly a C compiler is generating?",1
"Cant see the error ? You mean your compiler crashes as badly on this code that you even can't tell us what he is complaining about?",0
"You want to compress strings from argv, really? Or do you mean you want to treat argv's elements as names of files to compress, like gzip the program does?",0
"BTW you typo'd the declaration of `bytes_read`. And what on earth is incertitude?",0
"Too vague - explain what you expect the contents of the array to be afterwards - give a concrete example. Possibly also needs a homework tag ?",0
"@omri yes you are right... I have applied the logic acc. to what I thought is right if somebody could tell me what's wrong I have done ?????",0
"Please specify the platform you are compiling on, and also specify the command line options to the compiler that you're using. Is `-std=c99` one of the options, for example?",1
"You could have forgotten an include that defined a type, forgotten a smicolon, lots of things. Can you paste the code 10 lines before and after the location that the error indicates?",1
"The nth letter? Is this the Roman version of the Fibonacci sequence?",0
"I'm always amazed at how many questions are similar to this. Are people itching to write code like this?",0
"Good question, worded poorly. Might want to try rephrasing it?",0
"no way! can you show us the entire loop?",1
"Generally, I'd anticipate a code bug. Can you paste in your FD_SET and your select calls please?",1
"Why is your code stored in a `.cpp` (C++) file, while the question is about C? So, what is it C++ or C?",0
"I added commentary. Does that explain what happens now?",0
"I haven't ever experience `GetClientRect` returning anything but the full client rectangle, no matter what overlaps it or if it is fully on-screen. Are you sure?",1

"I don't understand what's wrong with the standard C pre-processor. Can you clarify?",1
"why not `fprintf`? is this a homework?",0
"i can input number, number1. skips to letter2 why?",0
"You don't have any call to `fork()` in your sample program. Is this intentional?",0

"how much have you studied yet? Do you want specific questions?",0
"Can we see the function that creates the output? And the output itself?",1
"Doing a redundant `atoi` after you just did `strtol` is probably the most twisted insult to the proper use of string-to-int conversion functions in C one can come up with. Why do you see the need to re-convert the value using the broken function `atoi` when you already have it as `val` from a proper function `strtol`?",0

"In addition to reformatting, can you try to provide some more info? Where are you stuck, what's going wrong?",1

"I've clarified the question, thanks ax. @runrunraygun: What is a community wiki?",1
"Why? 99% of the time you can convert well written C code to C++ code by just changing the compiler setting. Why not start using C++ code?",0
"Your code will result in 0.5. So what's your problem?",0
"It may be redundant in source, but is it redundant in binary? Is it a good practice to always check code like this because although all statements depend on the ones before them (in program flow), the program flow may change from any number of sources?",1
"This looks right, and works for me. What do you see?",1
"Why not K&R? Was this just an excuse to bad-mouth some books you didn't like?",0

"How are you doing your shared memory? With shm_open and mmap?",1
"Who gives you such error? Did you compile your source using `proc` ?",0
"I don't think there's any optimal way to do it other than just scanning the string looking for the delimiters. Perhaps _you_ could code that yourself?",0
"@kelton52, then the problem is at compile time rather than run time. There should still be behaviour, error messages from the compiler perhaps?",1

"To quote Scott Meyers: `make`? Who needs stinkin `make`?.",0
"qsort does sort lines in increasing order, but your definition of increasing isn't the same as everybody else's. Why do you think it's more logical to sort strings by length rather than by alphabetical order?",0

"To answer your last question, you want to use `extern C` to prevent the name-mangling. Not sure about the first one yet though; have you verified that you're actually being sent any messages?",1
"Yes, that is the real source code. And the compilation has been performed without optimization, perhaps that is the reason?",1
"Since you're only trying to detect gnome vs kde, is there a particular set of distros or configurations you're targeting? How general does the solution have to be?",1
"@luser droog: I can surely try! where can I look at that source?",1
"How do you know it's not returning a 64-bit pointer? Have you done `sizeof(void *)` to check?",0

"This doesn't make sense. Do you mean introspection?",0
"Can you provide more details? Did your application launch at all before you received this dialog?",1
"Perhaps also a bit of information about the parameters to `Field()` would help. Also, are you trying to use a 1D or a 2D array to store the fields?",1
"Why are we reloading the page? Can't one manage all the data to be changed in a stream to the applet directly, or AJAX javascript?",0
"The answers all assume a different type of output. Can you give an example of how you want the output to look (or does it just need to be readable?)",1
"Sorry to up this, I found it via google, but it seems to work when the private static final field is a primitive type. Does anyone have an idea why ?",1

"I just tried this bc I was thinking along the same lines but for some reason when I implement with my data1.csv file it makes no difference, I think it is because of userID numbering and lettering. Is possible for me to send you the data file, so you can see what I mean?",1
